Question:

For part B we were performing 64 memory accesses and performing 64 floating point computes, addition and multiplication. This gives us a CGMA ration of 1.

For part C we calculated that we were doing 64 floating point calculations per 2 accesses to global memory. This gives us a CGMA ration of 32 for and ideal situation where all threads are being utilized.
